DISTANCE & BEARING
===================

MATLAB code for calculation of distances and bearing between two geographical
positions (inverse method), and calculation of a final geographical position 
from an initial geographical position, distance and initial bearing.

There are three methods: pitagoras (simplest, suitable for small areas of the
order of few km), haversine (somewhat more complex, better accuracy than
pitagoras), vincenty (the most accurate, best accuracy).
